The repository contains the Python code for SparkFun NEO-M8U GPS, CMPS12 compass, and Adafruit PCA9685 I2C Servo controller.

####
The NEO-M8U unit returns a lot more values than just lattitude and longitude.
For this project the latitude and the longitude were the only required values (as well as the longitude heading).
Another file with the complete redout of GPS data will be posted soon

###
The CMPS-12 compass returns a value between 0 and 3599.
The compass is a complete solution for those looking for a peripheral to output a heading without fuss.
